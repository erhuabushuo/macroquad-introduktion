# Acknowledgments

Thanks to mom and dad, and the rest of my family. I want to give an extra special thanks to the following people:

* Niklas Elmgren for designing the cover
* Kathrin Hagmaier for help with proofreading and consistency check
* Peter Strömberg for user testing and additional content
* The Art of Code for the starfield shader
* Esther Arzola for the beautiful image of Ferris with a teacher’s hat
* Fedor Logachev for developing Macroquad
* Everyone who designed game assets and placed them in the public domain

And of course to everybody who has followed the guide, has cheered me on or given feedback and suggestions.

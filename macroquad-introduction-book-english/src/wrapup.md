# The end

![Ferris the teacher](images/ferris-teacher-small.png)

You have now developed and published a simple game written in the programming
language Rust and the game library Macroquad. While there is still a lot to be
done to make it into a complete game, you should now have a solid foundation
to improve the game further.

## Try the game

Click to <a href="game.html" target="_blank"
onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'toolbar=no,location=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=640,height=480'); return false;">play the game</a>
to see how it will look when it's finished.

## Ideas for improvement

Here are some ideas on how to improve the game to make it more fun to play:

* Add more enemies with different movements and graphics
* Add life to enemies so bigger enemies needs to shot multiple times before they are destroyed
* Allow enemies to shoot bullets or drop bombs themselves
* Make enemies show up in waves instead of just randomly
* Add levels with increasing difficulty
* Upgrades that improve the weapons or add different types of weapons
* Add big boss enemies at the end of levels
* Extra lives
* Add health and display a health bar
* Add an upgrade with a shield around the spaceship
* Store the top ten scores and add a highscore screen
* Use [macroquad-tiled](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/tree/master/tiled) to make a level with graphical background
* Add a shop between levels to buy upgrades
* Make the spaceship invulnerable and blinking for a short while after resurrection
* Look at the Macroquad [post processing](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/blob/master/examples/post_processing.rs) example on how to add a CRT shader
* Use the font from the [graphical menu chapter](ch13-menu-ui.md) for all texts in the game
* Show a victory sequence at the end of each level
* Support two simultaneous players
